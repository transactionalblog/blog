Filesystems, async file IO, and durability.

== Filesystems

:uri-phoronix-fs-bench: https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-58-filesystems/
:uri-scylladb-qual-fs: https://www.scylladb.com/2016/02/09/qualifying-filesystems/

Prefer XFS if you can.  It {uri-phoronix-fs-bench}[benchmarks overall well].
It handles a bunch of special cases well that are {uri-scylladb-qual-fs}[important for databases].

It's possible to open a raw block device and entirely bypass the filesystem.
Doing so requires that all reads and writes be 4k aligned and a multiple of 4k
in size. It also requires reimplementing everything that comes for free with a
filesystem: free block tracking, disk space usage reporting, snapshot-based
backup/restore, application logging, drive health testing.  Anecdotally, I've
heard that the advantage of all of this is an ~10% speedup, so not a tradeoff
that's often worth the cost.  But for easy experimentation and testing of direct
block storage access, a loopback device (man:losetup[8]) allows mounting a file
as a block device.

== Don't Use FS Wrong

Filesystems maintain metadata about how blocks are associated with files, and
optimizing around this will lead to lower latency.  Ext4 and XFS both can
aggregate contiguous blocks in a file into a single _extent_, reducing the
metadata overhead.  This encourages appending to files in large chunks at a time
(or using fallocate to extend the file before performing a series of small
appends).  Maintaining large extents also potentially discourages excessive use
of some filesystem metadata calls, as e.g. fine-grained use of
FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE would be an easy way to continuously fragment extents.
Large files incur large metadata, and so it's often a good idea to incrementally
truncate down a large file before unlinking it, otherwise the entire metadata
traversal and deleting will be performed synchronously with the unlink.

How the storage device is attached to the system changes the number of parallel
operations it can possibly support.  (And the range is wide: SATA NCQ supports
32 concurrent requests, NVMe supports 65k.)  If you submit more than this,
there's implicit queuing that happens in the kernel.  Theoretically
man:ionice[1] and man:ioprio_set[2] offer some control over how requests are
prioritized in that queue, but I've never really noticed ionice make a
difference.

== Use Fsync Right

https://danluu.com/file-consistency/[Dan Luu's File Consistency page] and links therein provide a nice overview of 

Top rules:

1. Write new file => fsync file.  fsync directory.
2. First open of mutable file => fsync.
3. Write into file: fdatasync.

== (Un)Buffered IO

:uri-preadv2-prwitev2: https://man.archlinux.org/man/pwritev2.2.en#preadv2()_and_pwritev2()
:uri-linux-on-odirect: https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/o_direct.html

Most databases do unbuffered (O_DIRECT) IO, and maintain their own page cache.
Some notable examples (e.g. rocksdb) don't. 
There are advantages both ways.  Direct control over the page cache allows for better caching decisions (e.g. don't evict the root node of the btree).  Using the system page cache notably offers an easy, elastic cache that's trivially shared with other processes on same machine.

If using buffered IO, {uri-preadv2-pwritev2}[preadv2/prwritev2's flags] can be helpful. 

{uri-linus-on-odirect}[Linus on O_DIRECT] is informative for the OS/DB world view mismatch.


== How to do IO

:uri-libeio: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libeio.html

There's a number of different ways to do asychronous IO in linux.  Prefer them in the following order: io_uring > aio > epoll > select.  Support for doing more than asynchronous reading and writing decreases rapidly the further one gets from io_uring.  For example, io_uring supports an async fallocate, but aio doesn't; aio supports async fsync, and epoll doesn't.  A library which issues synchronous filesystems calls on background threads, like {uri-libeo}[libeio], will be needed to fill in support where it's missing.

For commentary on each of these, the libev source code is a treasure which catalogs all the caveats in a starting rant:

* http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev_epoll.c?view=markup#l41[libev/ev_epoll.c]
* http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev_linuxaio.c?view=markup#l41[libev/ev_linuxaio.c] -- highly recommended reading
* http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev_iouring.c?view=markup#l41[libev/ev_iouring.c] -- "overall, the _API_ itself is, I dare to say, not a total trainwreck."


== Kernel Things

* Be aware of IO scheduler https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/IOSchedulers
* You can periodically scrape /proc/diskstats to self-report on disk metrics
* If using buffered io, be aware of vm.dirty_ratio https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/sysctl/vm.html#dirty-ratio
