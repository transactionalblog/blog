Each simulation test has one or more concurrent workloads.  Defining 

== Design

A workload has four phases:

Setup:: Initialize the system under test for this workload.

Run:: Perform this workload's specified task.

Check:: Verify something about the system under test.

Metrics:: Export any metrics recorded for this execution for aggregation and reporting

[source, cpp]
----
class Workload {
 public:
  virtual future<void> setup(Database& db) { return; }
  virtual future<void> run(Database& db) { return; }
  virtual future<void> check(Database& db) { return; }
  virtual future<vector<Metric>> getMetrics() { return vector<Metric>(); }
};
----

=== Property Tests

Property tests assert something about the correctness of the database.

`CycleTest` is a simple yet effective workload which validates transactional consistency, but not durability.  It creates a cycle of key-value pairs in the database by having each value be the key of the next element in the cycle.

[source, cpp]
----
future<void> CycleTest::setup(Database& db) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        co_await db.set( std::to_string(i), std::to_string( (i+1) % 100 ));
    }
}
----

After the cycle is created, the workload spends the majority of its time transactionally switching the order of two nodes in the cycle.

[source, cpp]
----
future<void> CycleTest::run(Database& db) {
    Transaction tr = db.create_transaction();
    Key k1 = std::to_string(random(0, 100));
    Key k2 = co_await tr.get(k1);
    Key k3 = co_await tr.get(k2);
    Key k4 = co_await tr.get(k3);
    // Transform 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 into 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4.
    tr.set(k1, k3);
    tr.set(k3, k2);
    tr.set(k2, k4);
    co_await tr.commit();
}
----

Once the workload has been stopped, we verify that there's still a 100 node cycle in the database.  If not all operations from a transaction are applied to the database, then either a new (shorter) cycle will be introduced or the cycle will be broken.

[source, cpp]
----
future<void> CycleTest::check(Database& db) {
    const Key firstKey = "0";
    Key key = firstKey;
    for (int count = 0; count < 99; count++) {
        key = co_await db.get(key);
        // Ensure that the cycle did not become shorter than 100 nodes.
        if (key == firstKey) throw ConsistencyViolation();
    }
    key = co_await db.get(key);
    // Ensure that the cycle did not become longer than 100 nodes.
    if (key != firstKey) throw ConsistencyViolation();
}
----


- IncrementTest



Property tests can validate any piece of the system.  `BackupToDBCorrectness` defines a test which:

- In setup(), begins taking a backup.
- In run(), 

- BackupToDBCorrectness


=== Nemesis Tests

- Attrition
- Clogging
- Swizzled
- ConfigureDatabase

=== Special Mention

- Fuzz API
- Quiescense

== Implementation

== Constraints

Workloads that aren't tractable in simulation:

- Workloads that assert operation latency 

- Workloads that assert an amount of work was performed
