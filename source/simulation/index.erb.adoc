# Motivation

# Deterministic Simulation
## Scheduling
## Time
## Mockable External Services: Networking
## Live External Services: Disks
## Processes and Machines
## Other Examples
- Go: https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate/tree/268c588e302f13187309e4b37636d19595d42fa1/internal/kernel
- Zig: Tigerbeetle
- C++ish: FDB
- Java: Cassandra D-Tests

# Failure Modeling
## Networking
## Disks
## Processes and Machines
## Buggify

# Simulation Workloads
## Property Testing
## Nemesis Tests
## Limitations
   - Quiescence
   - Performance testing very limited
