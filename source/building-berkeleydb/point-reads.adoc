Support for searching down the tree in search of a single value.

== API

BerkeleyDB offers a `get()` method on `DB`, allowing the reading of the stored value corresponding to a key.  To represent a key or value, it uses a `DBT` struct which describes the memory and its size.

.db.h
[source,c]
----
/**
 * Key/data structure -- a Data-Base Thang
 *
 * That's the actual comment from the BerkeleyDB source code.
 */
struct DBT {
  void   *data;    ///< Key/data
  u_int32_t size;  ///< Key/data length

  u_int32_t ulen;  ///< Only used with DB_DBT_USERMEM
  u_int32_t dlen;  ///< Only used with DB_DBT_PARTIAL
  u_int32_t doff;  ///< Only used with DB_DBT_PARTIAL

  void *app_data;  ///< Applications are allowed to associate opaque data.

  u_int32_t flags; ///< Unused
}
----

The `get()` method to implement is defined as:

.dh.h
[source,c]
----
struct DB {
  /**
   * Get the value for a key.
   *
   * It is the user's responsibility to manage the memory pointed to by
   * `key`, and ensure that it is valid for the lifetime of the call.
   *
   * `data` should be zero-initialized upon calling get(), and it is the
   * library's responsibility to manage the memory pointed to by data->data.
   * This memory will remain valid until the next call to the library which
   * returns a DBT to the user.
   *
   * @param db The opened DB in which to fetch a key.
   * @param txn The transaction within which this get operation is scoped.
   *            For us, this must be NULL.
   * @param key A DBT owned by the user to describe the kv-pair to fetch.
   * @param data A zero-initialized DBT, which will be written to with
   *             the data and size of the associated data.
   * @param flags Ignored for us.
   * @return 0, if the key was found
   *         DB_NOTFOUND, if the key was not found
   */
  int (*get)(DB *db, DB_TXN *txn, DBT *key, DBT *data, u_int32_t flags);

  // The default mode of operation is that the library is responsible for
  // freeing or reusing any returned state when the next call to any data
  // returning operation is made.  The way that this works is that the DB
  // struct has members which let you store what had been returned to a
  // user previously, so that you can remember what pointers had been
  // returned on a previous call.  There's more to remember for other APIs
  // but for now, we only need to remember what was returned in the `data`
  // argument to `get`.
  DBT  my_rdata;  ///< My Remembered Data.
}

There are flags you could optionally support, if it'd make it easier for you to write tests or demo code:

* `DB_DBT_MALLOC`: `data` was allocated via `malloc()`, and it is the caller's responsibility to `free()` it.
* `DB_DBT_USERMEM`: `data` was allocated by the user, and points to a region of memory of size `ulen`.

If you don't support any flags, I would suggest ``ASSERT()``ing that `flags` is `0`, or return `-ENOTSUP`, as if you try out some bindings with your library later and they happen to pass the flags, it'll lead to a corruption or crash.

== Algorithm

Examining the entries in an internal B-Tree page is going to yield ``InternalEntry``s that look like:

[ditaa]
----
           Root Page

           +-----+----+----+----+----+
  offsets: | 100 | 80 | 60 | 40 | 20 |
           +-----+----+----+----+----+
           0     1    2    3    4

hf_offset: +-------------------------+
           |                         |
      20   | PgNo 6, Data "VVVV"     |
           |                         |
           +-------------------------+
           |                         |
      40   | PgNo 5, Data "QQQQ"     |
           |                         |
           +-------------------------+
           |                         |
      60   | PgNo 4, Data "MMMM"     |
           |                         |
           +-------------------------+
           |                         |
      80   | PgNo 3, Data "FFFF"     |
           |                         |
           +-------------------------+
           |                         |
     100   | PgNo 2, Data "BBBB"     |
           |                         |
           +-------------------------+

And the goal is to find the correct next page to read by comparing the target key against the data in the `InternalEntry`.  Your goal is to find the maximum key that's less than or equal to your target key.  If `get()` was provided a target key of `NNNN`, then the goal is to identify offset 60 of `PgNo: 4, Data: MMMM` as the proper entry, and repeat the search on page 4 next.  One could binary search this, but the offsets are maintained in order, and so I found a linear scan the easiest.

Specifically, for internal pages, iterate over the entries with a _sliding_ window of size 2, such that one visits the offset pairs of:

* (NULL, 100)
* (100, 80)
* (80, 60)
* (60, 40)
* (40, 20)
* (20, NULL)

in specifically that order.  You're searching to find a `(left, right)`, where `left.data <= target_key && target_key < right.data`, and skip the comparison on `NULL`.  If your target key is less than the first ``InternalEntry``'s data value, then your target key is not found in the B-Tree.  Start with the root page.  Repeat on each page indicated by the identified ``InternalEntry``'s PgNo until you reach a page where `page.level == 1`.

Once you're on a leaf page, there will be ``KeyDataEntry``s instead.

Recall that there will always be an even number of offsets and entries on a leaf page, with the first entry being a key, and the second being the data.  Iterate over all the entries in pairs (a tumbling window of size 2), and if `pair[0].data == target_key`, then return `pair[1].data` as the found key.  If was no matching key, then the key doesn't exist in the B-Tree.

== Task

Using the test data generated by `gendata.py` provided in link:page-format.html[Page Format], implement the support necessary to run:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <db.h>

#define DATABASE "testdata.bdb"

void test_get(DB* dbp, const char* keystr) {
    DBT key, data;

    // Zero-initialize key/data pair
    memset(&key, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    memset(&data, 0, sizeof(DBT));
    key.data = (char*)keystr;
    key.size = strlen(key.data);

    // Get data from the database
    int rc = dbp->get(dbp, NULL, &key, &data, 0);
    if (rc == 0)
        printf("key: %s, data: %s\n", (char *)key.data, (char *)data.data);
    else if (rc == DB_NOTFOUND)
        printf("key not found\n");
    else
        printf("Unknown error: %d\n", rc);
}

int main() {
    DB *dbp;
    int ret;

    // Initialize DB structure
    if ((ret = db_create(&dbp, NULL, 0)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "db_create: %s\n", db_strerror(ret));
        exit(1);
    }

    // Open the database
    if ((ret = dbp->open(dbp, NULL, DATABASE, NULL, DB_BTREE, DB_CREATE, 0664)) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "dbp->open: %d\n", ret);
        goto err;
    }

    test_get(dbp, "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb");
    test_get(dbp, "kjshdfkhjdsfhdsj");
    test_get(dbp, "ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss");

err:
    if (dbp != NULL)
        dbp->close(dbp, 0);

    return 0;
}
----

Which should output:

[source,c]
----
key: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb, data: bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
key not found
key: ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, data: ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
