:page-hook: Every transactional system must execute, order, validate, and persist transactions.

:section: ยง

Every transactional system does four things:

* It _executes_ transactions.
* It _orders_ transactions.
* It _validates_ transactions.
* It _persists_ transactions.

_Executing_ a transaction means evaluating the body of the transaction to produce the intended reads and writes.  There is still notable variety across systems as to how the body of a transaction is executed.  Writes might be applied to storage during this phase, or they might be buffered locally and submitted as a batch at the end.  A transaction might be executed more than once for different purposes.

_Ordering_ a transaction means assigning the transaction some notion of a time at which it occurred.  This could be a version, a timestamp, a log sequence number, or a more complex description of transaction IDs it happened before or after.  MVCC databases may assign two versions: an initial read version, and a final commit version. In this case, we're mainly focused on the specific point at which the commit version is chosen -- the time at which the database claims all reads and writes occurred atomically.

_Validating_ a transaction means enforcing concurrency control, or more rarely, domain-specific semantics.  If a transaction is going to be rejected for a system defined reason, such as having serializability conflicts with existing transactions, it will happen here.  When validation happens after ordering, it checks to see if the assigned order is valid.  When validation happens before ordering, it provides a range of acceptable commit versions, and the ordering step chooses one of them.

_Persisting_ a transaction makes making it durable, generally to disk.  Sometimes writes are incrementally made durable during transaction execution, but the key point in persistence is when all writes _and_ the commit record marking the transaction as committed are durable.  Often this is noting how the system performs replication and persists the outcome of its atomic commitment protocol.  (And sometimes the lines between those two aren't very clear.)

All four of these things must be done before the system may acknowledge a transaction's result to a client.  However, these steps can be done in any order.  They can be done concurrently.  Different systems achieve different tradeoffs by reordering these steps.

== Examples

A classic optimistic concurrency control database will execute a transaction, and record the read and write sets.  Once execution finishes, a commit version is allocated, and concurrent transactions are checked for conflicts.  If no conflicts were found, the transaction is made durable, and acknowledged as committed.  

Classic optimistic concurrency control databases break down as:

[dbdiag-spans]
----
OCC: Execute
OCC: Order
OCC: Validate
OCC: Persist

A classic pessimistic concurrency control database executes a transaction and acquires locks as it runs to exclude conflicting transactions.  When the transaction finishes, it acquires a commit version, and then is persisted to disk.  Then it releases the locks.

=== FoundationDB

biblink:[FoundationDB]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] is a distributed, transactional database, which unbundles the standard database architecture into a set of database microservices which may be scaled independently.  The paper describes its transaction processing flow as:
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[FoundationDB]#

[quote]
____
A client transaction starts by contacting one of the Proxies to obtain
a read version (i.e., a timestamp). The Proxy then asks the Sequencer
for a read version that is guaranteed to be no less than any
previously issued transaction commit version, and this read version
is sent back to the client. [.txn-execute]#Then the client may issue multiple reads
to StorageServers and obtain values at that specific read version.
Client writes are buffered locally without contacting the cluster.#
At commit time, the client sends the transaction data, including
the read and write sets (i.e., key ranges), to one of the Proxies
and waits for a commit or abort response from the Proxy. If the
transaction cannot commit, the client may choose to restart the
transaction from the beginning again.

A Proxy commits a client transaction in three steps. [.txn-order]#First, the
Proxy contacts the Sequencer to obtain a commit version that is
larger than any existing read versions or commit versions.# The
Sequencer chooses the commit version by advancing it at a rate of
one million versions per second. [.txn-validate]#Then, the Proxy sends the transaction
information to range-partitioned Resolvers, which implement
FDB's optimistic concurrency control by checking for read-write
conflicts#. If all Resolvers return with no conflict, the transaction
can proceed to the final commit stage. Otherwise, the Proxy marks
the transaction as aborted. [.txn-persist]#Finally, committed transactions are sent
to a set of LogServers for persistence#. A transaction is considered
committed after all designated LogServers have replied to the
Proxy, which reports the committed version to the Sequencer (to
ensure that later transactions' read versions are after this commit)
and then replies to the client. At the same time, StorageServers
continuously pull mutation logs from LogServers and apply committed
updates to disks.
____

So from breaking down this part of the paper, we see

. A client executes a transaction.
. The proxy acquires a commit version.
. The transaction is conflict checked.
. The transaction is made durable.

All as sequential steps.

A familiar diagram!  FoundationDB operates as a classic optimistic concurrency control database.  With this in mind, if you're trying to understand one piece of the system (e.g. distributed conflict checking in the resolvers), you can replace the other pieces temporarily with the minimal equivalents from the most simplistic optimistic database implementation (e.g. replace the log servers with appending to a single WAL on one disk).

=== Spanner

biblink:[Spanner]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] is Google's flagship database, used extensively within Google, and inspired a generation of NewSQL databases that followed in its architectural footsteps{nospace}sidenote:ref[] of partitioned Paxos and distributed transactions.  For Spanner's description of its transaction protocol, we see {section}4.2.1 Read-Write Transactions:
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[Spanner]#
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] And comparing specifically how CockroachDB, TiDB, and YugabyteDB all differ from Spanner and each other is an insightful adventure.#

[quote]
____
Like Bigtable, writes that occur in a transaction are
buffered at the client until commit. As a result, reads
in a transaction do not see the effects of the transaction's
writes. This design works well in Spanner because a read
returns the timestamps of any data read, and uncommitted writes have not yet been assigned timestamps.

Reads within read-write transactions use wound-wait to avoid deadlocks.
[.txn-execute.txn-validate]#The client issues reads
to the leader replica of the appropriate group, which
acquires read locks and then reads the most recent
data. While a client transaction remains open, it sends
keepalive messages to prevent participant leaders from
timing out its transaction. When a client has completed
all reads and buffered all writes, it begins two-phase
commit.# The client chooses a coordinator group and
sends a commit message to each participant's leader with
the identity of the coordinator and any buffered writes.
Having the client drive two-phase commit avoids sending data twice across wide-area links.

[.txn-validate]#A non-coordinator-participant leader first acquires
write locks.# It then chooses a prepare timestamp that
must be larger than any timestamps it has assigned to previous transactions (to preserve monotonicity), and logs a
prepare record through Paxos. Each participant then notifies the coordinator of its prepare timestamp.

The coordinator leader also first acquires write locks,
but skips the prepare phase. [.txn-order]#It chooses a timestamp for
the entire transaction after hearing from all other participant leaders.# The commit timestamp s must be greater or
equal to all prepare timestamps (to satisfy the constraints
discussed in Section 4.1.3), greater than TT.now().latest
at the time the coordinator received its commit message,
and greater than any timestamps the leader has assigned
to previous transactions (again, to preserve monotonicity). [.txn-persist]#The coordinator leader then logs a commit record
through Paxos (or an abort if it timed out while waiting
on the other participants).#

Before allowing any coordinator replica to apply
the commit record, the coordinator leader waits until
TT.after(s), so as to obey the commit-wait rule described
in Section 4.1.2. Because the coordinator leader chose s
based on TT.now().latest, and now waits until that timestamp is guaranteed to be in the past, the expected wait
is at least 2 * epsilon. This wait is typically overlapped with
Paxos communication. After commit wait, the coordinator sends the commit timestamp to the client and all
other participant leaders. Each participant leader logs the
transaction's outcome through Paxos. [.txn-validate]#All participants
apply at the same timestamp and then release locks.#
____

Spanner is a bit more complicated, partly because lock-related operations involved in transaction validation are stretched across the whole text.  It also tries to trick you by talking about details out of execution order, so make sure to always read closely for "then" to give hints on the ordering of the steps.

. The execute and validate steps seem to be intertwined, as read locks are acquired while the transaction executes.
. Writes are buffered until the client is ready to commit.
. Two-phase commit is started to check if the transaction can commit on all participants.
. After the coordinator has heard all of the minimum required timestamps from its participants during the two-phase commit's prepare, it decides the final commit version.
. The transaction is then made durable.
. Finally, read and write locks are released.

Drawing this out, Spanner looks like:

[dbdiag-spans]
----
[
Spanner: Validate CC
Spanner: Execute EX
]
[
Spanner: END EX
]
Spanner: Order
Spanner: Persist
Spanner: END CC
----

Oh hey, it still looks exactly like a classic pessimistic concurrency control database.  So despite the significantly more complicated explanation of how transactions are executed, it's reasonable to approach the paper from the viewpoint of "How does this end up being equal to SERIALIZABLE MySQL?", and you can think through how the two systems differ piece by piece.

=== TAPIR

biblink:[TAPIR]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] is a strictly serializable database advertising itself as an improvement on Spanner that can commit transactions with better latency and throughput through the use of its novel replication protocol. The core of TAPIR is described in {section}5.2.1:
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[TAPIR]#

[quote]
____
[.txn-execute]#We begin with TAPIR's protocol for executing transactions.#

1. For `Write(key, object)`, the client buffers `key` and `object` in
the write set until commit and returns immediately.
2. For `Read(key)`, if `key` is in the transaction's write set, the
client returns `object` from the write set. If the transaction
has already read `key`, it returns a cached copy. Otherwise,
the client sends `Read(key)` to the replica.
3. On receiving `Read`, the replica returns `object` and `version`,
where `object` is the latest version of `key` and `version` is the
timestamp of the transaction that wrote that version.
4. On response, the client puts `(key, version)` into the transaction's read set and returns `object` to the application.

Once the application calls Commit or Abort, the execution
phase finishes. To commit, the TAPIR client coordinates
across all participants -- the shards that are responsible for
the keys in the read or write set -- to find a single timestamp,
consistent with the strict serial order of transactions, to assign
the transaction's reads and writes, as follows:

1. [.txn-order]#The TAPIR client selects a proposed timestamp. Proposed
timestamps must be unique, so clients use a tuple of their
local time and their client id.#
2. The TAPIR client invokes `Prepare(txn, timestamp)` as an
IR consensus operation, where `timestamp` is the proposed
timestamp and `txn` includes the transaction id (`txn.id`)
and the transaction read (`txn.read set`) and write sets
(`txn.write set`). The client invokes Prepare on all participants
through IR as a consensus operations.
3. Each TAPIR replica that receives Prepare (invoked by IR
through ExecConsensus) first checks its transaction log for
`txn.id`. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK if the transaction
committed or ABORT if the transaction aborted.
4. Otherwise, the replica checks if txn.id is already in its
prepared list. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK.
5. [.txn-validate]#Otherwise, the replica runs TAPIR's OCC validation
checks, which check for conflicts with the transaction's
read and write sets at timestamp, shown in Figure 8.#
6. Once the TAPIR client receives results from all shards, the
client sends `Commit(txn, timestamp)` if all shards replied
PREPARE-OK or `Abort(txn, timestamp)` if any shards
replied ABORT or ABSTAIN. If any shards replied RETRY,
then the client retries with a new proposed timestamp (up
to a set limit of retries).
7. [.txn-persist]#On receiving a Commit, the TAPIR replica: (1) commits the
transaction to its transaction log, (2) updates its versioned
store with w, (3) removes the transaction from its prepared
list (if it is there), and (4) responds to the client.#
8. On receiving a Abort, the TAPIR replica: (1) logs the
abort, (2) removes the transaction from its prepared list (if
it is there), and (3) responds to the client.
____

Which initially feels like a lot of description to work through, but it breaks down into separable pieces pretty well:

. The transaction is executed.
. The clients picks a proposed commit timestamp.
. Each replica then concurrently runs an OCC check and persists the data to the prepare log.

Thus, our diagram looks like:

[dbdiag-spans]
----
TAPIR: Execute
TAPIR: Order
[
TAPIR: Validate CC
TAPIR: Persist DR
]
TAPIR: END CC
TAPIR: END DR
----

This also highlights the key aspect of TAPIR: its blending of the concurrency control validation and commit outcome persistence protocols.

Tangentially, TAPIR was the inspiration behind this way of decomposing databases, as it included a nice diagram which I occasionally fell back to when reading papers I struggled to make sense of:

image::tapir-diagram.png[embed=true,align=center]

And this taxonomy is just adding transaction execution, and looking at how those layers are executed across a dimension of time as well.

=== Calvin

biblink:[Calvin]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] is the iconic system for deterministic databases, and subsequent papers improving on various aspects of its design all share the same overall characteristics.  In {section}3 System Architecture, Calvin's architecture is introduced as:
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[Calvin]#

[quote]
____
The essence of Calvin lies in separating the system into three separate layers of processing:

โข [.txn-order]#The sequencing layer (or โsequencerโ) intercepts transactional inputs and places them into a global transactional input
sequence#โthis sequence will be the order of transactions to
which all replicas will ensure serial equivalence during their
execution. [.txn-persist]#The sequencer therefore also handles the replication and logging of this input sequence.#
โข The scheduling layer (or โschedulerโ) [.txn-validate.txn-execute]#orchestrates transaction execution using a deterministic locking scheme to guarantee equivalence to the serial order specified by the sequencing layer while allowing transactions to be executed concurrently by a pool of transaction execution threads#. (Although
they are shown below the scheduler components in Figure 1,
these execution threads conceptually belong to the scheduling layer.)
โข The storage layer handles all physical data layout. Calvin
transactions access data using a simple CRUD interface; any
storage engine supporting a similar interface can be plugged
into Calvin fairly easily.
____

This means Calvin breaks down as:

. Sequence the transaction into a global log.
. Make the log durable.
. Take locks to know when one can safely execute in the serial order despite concurrency.
. Execute the transaction.
. Drop all locks acquired.

[dbdiag-spans]
----
Calvin: Order
Calvin: Persist
Calvin: Validate CC
Calvin: Execute
Calvin: END CC
----

Calvin is the most well known example of a database which does *not* execute transactions before committing them. It gains some significant advantages from this, in that its commit process is completely immune to contention in the workload, and some disadvantages, in that long running transactions will stall any later committed transactions from executing.

=== CURP

biblink:[CommutativeRaft]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] defines a Consistent Unordered Replication Protocol (CURP), that allows clients to replicate requests that have not yet been ordered, as long as they are commutative. Stitching together a few paragraphs from {section}3.2 Normal operation:
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[CommutativeRaft]#

[quote]
____
Client interaction with masters is generally the same as it
would be without CURP. [.txn-execute]#Clients send update RPC requests
to masters.# If a client cannot receive a response, it retries the
update RPC. If the master crashes, the client may retry the
RPC with a different server.

For 1 RTT updates, masters return to clients before replication to
backups. [.txn-persist]#To ensure durability, clients directly record
their requests to witnesses concurrently while waiting for
responses from masters. Once all f witnesses have accepted
the requests, clients are assured that the requests will survive
master crashes, so clients complete the operations with the
results returned from masters.#

[.txn-validate]#A witness accepts a new record RPC from a client only
if the new operation is commutative with all operations that
are currently saved in the witness. If the new request doesn't
commute with one of the existing requests, the witness must
reject the record RPC since the witness has no way to order
the two noncommutative operations consistent with the
execution order in masters. For example, if a witness already
accepted โxโ1โ, it cannot accept โxโ5โ.#

Each of f witnesses operates independently; witnesses
need not agree on either ordering or durability of operations.
In an asynchronous network, record RPCs may arrive at
witnesses in different order, which can cause witnesses to
accept and reject different sets of operations. However, this
does not endanger consistency. First, as mentioned in ยง3.2.1,
a client can proceed without waiting for sync to backups
only if all f witnesses accepted its record RPCs. Second,
requests in each witness are required to be commutative
independently, and only one witness is selected and used
during recovery (described in ยง3.3).

The role of masters in CURP is similar to their role in
traditional primary-backup replications. Masters in CURP
receive, serialize, and execute all update RPC requests from
clients. [.txn-order]#If an executed operation updates the system state, the
master synchronizes (syncs) its current state with backups by
replicating the updated value or the log of ordered operations.#
____

Thus, we can decompose CURP into its pieces:

. Clients read from the master and send the writes to both the leader and all the followers of a replication group.
. Each replica concurrently checks for conflicts and records the transaction locally.
. After replying to the client, the transactions are ordered.

Thus, we have:

[dbdiag-spans]
----
CURP: Execute
[
CURP: Validate CC
CURP: Persist DR
]
[
CURP: END DR
CURP: END CC
]
CURP: Order
----

Which also very nicely shows how CURP is rather unique: ordering transactions is the last thing that it does, and ordering transactions last is how it derives all of its advantages.


=== TicToc

biblink:[TicToc]{nospace}sidenote:ref[] introduces itself as a new transaction protocol that assigns read and write timestamps to data items and uses them to lazily compute a valid commit timestamp for each transaction. Doing so removes the need for centralized timestamp allocation, and commits transactions that would be aborted by conventional timestamp ordering schemes.
[.aside]#sidenote:def[] bibitem:[TicToc]#

Sounds cool.  Stitching together some pieces of text from {section}3.2 Protocol Specification so that they read well in order, the transaction protocol is described as:

[quote]
____
[.txn-execute]#In the read phase, the DBMS maintains a separate read set and write set of tuples for each transaction. During this phase, accessed tuples are
copied to the read set and modified tuples are written to the write
set, which is only visible to the current transaction. Each entry in
the read or write set is encoded as {tuple, data, wts, rts}, where
tuple is a pointer to the tuple in the database, data is the data value
of the tuple, and wts and rts are the timestamps copied from the tuple when it was accessed by the transaction. For a read set entry, TicToc maintains the invariant that the version is valid from wts to rts in timestamp order.#

The first step of the validation phase is to lock
all the tuples in the transaction's write set in their primary key order
to prevent other transactions from updating the rows concurrently.
Using this fixed locking order guarantees that there are no deadlocks with other transactions committing at the same time.

[.txn-order]#The second step in the validation phase is to compute the transaction's commit timestamp from the timestamps stored within each
tuple entry in its read/write sets.# For a
tuple in the read set but not in the write set, the commit timestamp
should be no less than its wts since the tuple would have a different version before this timestamp. For a tuple in the transaction's
write set, however, the commit timestamp needs to be no less than
its current rts + 1 since the previous version was valid till rts.

[.txn-validate.txn-order]#In the last step, the algorithm validates the tuples in the transaction's read set. If the transaction's commit_ts is less than or equal
to the rts of the read set entry, then the invariant wts โค commit_ts
โค rts holds. This means that the tuple version read by the transaction is valid at commit_ts, and thus no further action is required.
If the entry's rts is less than commit_ts, however, it is not clear
whether the local value is still valid or not at commit_ts. It is possible that another transaction has modified the tuple at a logical time
between the local rts and commit_ts, which means the transaction
has to abort. Otherwise, if no other transaction has modified the
tuple, rts can be extended to be greater than or equal to commit_ts,
making the version valid at commit_ts.#

[.txn-persist]#Finally, if all of the tuples that the transaction accessed pass validation, then the transaction enters the write phase. In this phase the transaction's write set is written to the database.#
____

And so breaking that down, we see:

. The transaction is executed, with writes buffered until commit.
. _While_ the transaction executes, timestamps are recorded which narrow the possible range of commit versions.
. Once validation begins, a final commit timestamp is chosen and checked for conflicts.
. If all other steps are successful, the transaction is finally persisted.

Thus, the diagram looks something like:

[dbdiag-spans]
----
[
TicToc: Execute EX
TicToc: Order OD
]
TicToc: END EX
TicToc: Validate CC
TicToc: END OD
TicToc: END CC
TicToc: Persist
----

TicToc does _dynamic timestamp assignment_.  Instead of choosing a choosing a timestamp before execution, or proposing a timestamp right before commit, it narrows ranges of possible commit timestamps as it executes.

== Homework

With this in mind, here's a completely arbitrary sampling{nospace}sidenote:ref[] of some further systems from the top of my mind which all do transaction processing in rather different ways that you can use for practice:

== Composing Transactional Systems

A fun part of such a decomposition is that it can be inverted to raise fun questions.  Draw any made up diagram of a possible ordering or interleaving of execute, order, validate, and persist.  Now answer the question: how would I need to design a database such that it would decompose to this diagram?

From all the possible orderings and sets of concurrently executing steps, there's at least 74 different types of databases that can exist.  We've covered only a few of those, but each of them derives some interesting property from its different ordering of the steps of transaction processing.  Looking for a novel transactional system to build and publish about?  Find an ordering which hasn't been well explored in the literature before, design a system that executes transactions in that fashion, and then figure out what it's uniquely good and bad at.
