== outline

Three things you must do:

1. Order
2. Check for conflicts
3. Durable

Can be done in any order
Can be done concurrently
Must be done before you can tell a client "I accept your commit".

Durable: You must have the transaction recorded durably on disk.

Order: you must decide what transactions this one is before and after.  This doesn't _have_ to be a strict ordering, and some systems work with just a weak ordering, but _some_ ordering must exist to be able to resolve conflicts.

Commit: Decide if the outcome of the transaction is to commit or abort.
