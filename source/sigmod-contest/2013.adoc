== Detailed Description

:uri-contest-doxygen: https://transactionalblog.github.io/sigmod-contest-2013/core_8h.html

A contestant must implement 4 major functions: `StartQuery()`, `EndQuery()`, `MatchDocument()`, and `GetNextAvailRes()`. The detailed parameters and specifications of these functions are described {uri-contest-doxygen}[here].

These functions will be called by the testing framework. `StartQuery()` adds a query to the set of active queries, while `EndQuery()` removes it from that set. Each query is associated with the required matching type (exact, edit distance, or Hamming distance), and matching distance (for non exact matching).

`MatchDocument()` matches a document with the current set of active queries, and saves the result somewhere in the main memory, until it is requested by `GetNextAvailRes()`. That is, the number of calls to `GetNextAvailRes()` will be equal to the number of calls to `MatchDocument()`. Instead of letting `MatchDocument()` return the results directly, `GetNextAvailRes()` is introduced to allow the contestant to process several calls to `MatchDocument()` at the same time, using pthreads (which is recommended since the testing machine has 12 cores). However, using parallelism is not a requirement.

To successfully deliver results of a document, `GetNextAvailRes()` must return the document ID, along with all query IDs matching the document, sorted by query ID. Results of each document must be delivered exactly once. A call to `GetNextAvailRes()` must deliver results of any undelivered document, unless there are no such results.

The total size of active queries and temporary results will be at most 25% of the available main memory. The total number of calls to `StartQuery()` will be at least twice as the total number of calls to `MatchDocument()`. Since we are trying to model real queries, many queries will exhibit significant overlap.

The task API header file, a basic implementation of the task interface, the test driver along with an example workload, and a Makefile are available in the repo github:transactionalblog/sigmod-contest-2013[]. The README file inside the tarball explains how to compile and run the code.
